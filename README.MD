# Code Accompanying my Blog Post About Doing Weather Predictions with ML
See [Using Machine Learning to Predict the Weather in Basel](https://medium.com/@m.langer798/using-machine-learning-to-predict-the-weather-in-basel-pt-1-data-baselines-bb5c4d58458a)

## Download the data
You need to download historical weather data and save it to `src/main/resources/history_export_daily.csv` and 
`src/main/resources/history_export_hourly.csv` from [metoblue](https://www.meteoblue.com/de/wetter/archive/export/basel_schweiz_2661604) 
to run the examples. Make sure to check all metrics, and select daily and then hourly data. To have consistent results with the blog posts
choose CEST as your timezone, and download data from 1985-01-01 to 2018-08-30.
